It's the real code from my younger sister

### step1
```
    for (int item = 1; item <= 10; item++) {
        System.out.printf("%d * 1 = %d\t", item, item);
    }
```
`item` is a pretty good name!

### step2

```
    for (int a = 1; a < 10; a++) {
        for (int item = 1; item < 10; item++) {
            System.out.printf("%d * %d = %d\t", a, item, a * item);
        }
```
me: Why do you call it `a`? I don't think it's a good name

a few seconds later.....

my sister: You are right, then I would like to call it alen
